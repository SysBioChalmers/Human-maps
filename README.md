The maps are improved with the [Omix plugin](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/OMIX_plugin) developed by @pecholleyc.  
This repository is used to track the `*.omx` file generated by [Omix Visualization](https://www.omix-visualization.com). Since the file is essentially a system image file (not a text file), it is tracked with [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
